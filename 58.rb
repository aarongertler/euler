# It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting 
# is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

# If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. 
# If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes 
# along both diagonals first falls below 10%?

# Holy cow, this took 9 seconds to calculate, and I'm only running math and primality checks! It's not even that many operations...
# Could increase speed by moving outside the default Ruby primality algorithm and using something like Miller-Rabin
