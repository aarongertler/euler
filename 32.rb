# We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; 
# for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

# The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

# Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

# HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.


# There are 9! unique arrangements of the numbers 1 through 9 =/= 362000, which is manageable
# There are only four ways you can divide up any arrangement by digits (a * b = c): 1, 4, 4; 2, 3, 4; 3, 2, 4; 4, 1, 4
# We don't actually need to test the last two ways, since they'll inevitably mirror other products we've taken already;
# For example, 39 x 186 = 7254 will eventually be mirrored as 186 x 39 = 7254

# So the most basic brute-force procedure = take each permutation, divide it by 1_1_4 and 2_3_4, and grab any matching products
# We can also ignore any permutations that start with a first digit of 1 (1 * a = a, and a can't = a)


# Ruby has an existing permutation method, but here's a recursive algorithm to show the inner workings
# (Courtesy of http://stackoverflow.com/posts/25224355/revisions)

# Basic idea: Take each character in a string and add it to the front of all permutations of the other characters.
# How to get all permutations of the other characters? Same as the above. Recursion!
# So permutation('abc') becomes a + permutation(bc) + b + permutation (ac)...
# And permutation(bc) just returns b + c (bc) and c + b (cb)
