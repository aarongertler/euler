# Find the smallest x + y + z with integers x > y > z > 0 such that x + y, x − y, x + z, x − z, y + z, y − z are all perfect squares.


# What tricks do we know about finding numbers that are equidistant from two perfect squares?

# Nothing about odd/even parallels, that doesn't matter

# x must be in the middle of two different perfect square pairs, which themselves must have some special property...
# Maybe we try and find candidates for x first, to see if we can spot any patterns?
