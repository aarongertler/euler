# Let pn be the nth prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., and let r be the remainder when (pn−1)^n + (pn+1)^n is divided by pn^2.

# For example, when n = 3, p^3 = 5, and 4^3 + 6^3 = 280 ≡ 5 mod 25.

# The least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 10^9 is 7037. 

# Find the least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 10^10.


# Prime no. 7037 = 71059 (2 * n^2 is just over 10^10... hm)
