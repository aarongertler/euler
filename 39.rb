# Ways to do this faster: Use properties of Pythagorean triples to get down to well under a second 
# For example, see http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PythagoreanTriple.html
# Or use odd values of x and values of n > x to check a,b,c combinations where:
#   A = 2*x*n - x ** 2
#   B = 2*(n ** 2) - 2*x*n
#   C = 2*(n ** 2) - 2*x*n + x ** 2
# This will always give us Pythagorean triples (x = 1, n = 2 is 3, 4, 5, for example),
# so all we have to do is note which triples appear more often than others
