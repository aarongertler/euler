# We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n 
# exactly once. For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is also prime.

# What is the largest n-digit pandigital prime that exists?


# Largest possible prime would be 9 digits. But is that possible?
# No, because sum of 1 to 9 is 45, so any 9-digit pandigital number is divisible by 3
# Similarly, sum of 1 to 8 is 36, so any 8-digit pandigital number is divisible by 3

# Is a 7-digit pandigital prime possible? I don't see why not.
